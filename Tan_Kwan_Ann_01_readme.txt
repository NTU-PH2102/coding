#### README ####
To run the code, you will need a working installation of MathWorks(R) MATLAB.
Any versions newer than R2016a should work fine.

To obtain a copy of MATLAB, you can:
a) Purchase a Students' Edition for about US$49++
b) Purchase MATLAB by itself for a low price of US$2350.
There are strictly no other ways to obtain it.

Steps to successfully execute the code:
1) Install and activate MATLAB.
2) Launch MATLAB.
3) Under 'Home' tab, click 'Open'
4) Navigate to the code Tan_Kwan_Ann_02_matlab_code.m and click 'Open'.
5) Once the script file is loaded, click on the green arrow 'Run' to execute the script.

A new window should pop-up showing the 3D trajectory of the charged particle subjected to the fields
in the Penning trap.

Once done with viewing, you should close MATLAB as it is slightly resource-intensive.
