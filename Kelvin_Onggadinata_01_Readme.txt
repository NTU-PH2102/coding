The code is written using Spyder in Python language

The parameter to be adjusted is listed and explained in the additional notes. The program doesn't prompt user to input the parameter, so to change the parameter simply go to the main scipt and make direct changes.

The code is highly adapted from Ian Cooper's (University of Sydney) finite difference method. The animation is mainly adapted by Jake Vanderplas' github animation code and several other sources.

To see the animation in Spyder, we have to open an interactive window for it. If it doesn't open another window, do the following:

Chagne the backend to automatic:

Tools > preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics backend > Backend:Automatic.

Then close and open Spyder
