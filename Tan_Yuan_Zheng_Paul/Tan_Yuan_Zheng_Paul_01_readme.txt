I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Gabriel Wu, who suggested the RK4 method in solving the problem numericallly,
Mr Zaw Lin Htoo, who helped me out on the atan function and provided me great insight over email
and Dr Koh, who suggested including markers to improve presentation.

This animation was coded in Javascript, as such, no compiler is needed.
I have set the animation to look for the five js scripts in the js folder, so please do not move them or the animation will break.

If you have cloned or downloaded this repo/folder, open Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_01_main.html in the same folder to view the animation
If you have not (or do not know how to), go to https://sorewachigauyo.github.io/penning-trap/main.html
It is essentially the same file hosted on my personal github pages.
You may need to use another browser if the animation does not play.

If the animation still does not work, I have included a gif file but only diplaying 1000 frames.

The files in this directory are:
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_01_readme.txt : Readme
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_02_main.html : html page to view the animation
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_08_writeup.pdf : Writeup
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_09_backupanim.gif : Backup gif

in /js folder
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_03_main.js : The main script that sets up the animation and parameters
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_04_Particle.js : Particle object constructor and associated functions (like calculating current Lorentz force)
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_05_functions.js : Vector and other functions for easier calculations
Tan_Yuan_Zheng_Paul_06_Quadrupole.js : Quadrupole electric field and potential function
