# Instructions to run simulator
Download all the files with my name *into the same folder*, and just
run it on any decent, non-IE web browser.

(There might be a more updated version [here](https://zaw.li/!/penning))

## Credits

- The entirety of the animation was written in **three.js**, and hours
were spent trawling through their very helpful [documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)
- Also taken from the docs was the [**OrbitControls**](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/controls/OrbitControls) extension
- [Sue Lockwood](https://github.com/deathbearbrown/learning-three-js-blogpost)'s **labelAxis** function was taken from her blogpost about
redoing infographics in three.js, which itself depends on the **makeTextSprite**
function by [Lee Stemkoski](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Sprite-Text-Labels.html)
- Google Data Arts Team's [**dat.gui**](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui/) was used for the graphical user interface
