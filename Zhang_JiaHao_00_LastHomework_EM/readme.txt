Having unzipped this folder:
Run matlab, and navigate to the folder.

Run Zhang_JiaHao_02_Code.m
Then, open D.mat
	D.mat has been generated and saved so that rerunning of the program is not neccessary.

If you need to re-generate the data, just run the whole code.
	It creates the matrix storing the displacement information (D) and creates a .gif in the same folder.
